# Road-Sign-Detection-Using-ResNet

This project implements a Road Sign Detection model using the ResNet algorithm. The model was trained and validated using a dataset of road signs, achieving an impressive 98.39% validation accuracy. The goal is to automatically classify different types of road signs to assist in autonomous driving systems and traffic monitoring.

This project uses ResNet (Residual Networks) as the model architecture, achieving an impressive 98.39% validation accuracy. The input consists of images of various road signs, and the output is the predicted road sign category. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Road Sign Detection Dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset used for this project is the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB), which can be found on Kaggle. You can download it from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/safabouguezzi/german-traffic-sign-detection-benchmark-gtsdb.
